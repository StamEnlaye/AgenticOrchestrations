Section 4.2.1 of the DBC Executed Version confirms that, while the Design-Build Contractor generally bears site condition risks, limited relief is available for conditions inconsistent with the GBR, certain Utility Information, and the geotechnical data report included in the Reference Information Documents. These are recognized only for purposes of Relief Events under Article 15DBC Executed Version."
Does the Contractor have the Right to Terminate the contract or project if the Client is in Default? What Client Defaults give the Contractor the right to Terminate?,"Based on the provided sources, the Contractor has the right to terminate the contract or project if the Client is in default. According to Section 19.4.1 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2], the Contractor will have the right to terminate the Agreement and recover termination damages as more particularly set forth in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 20.4.\n\nThe Client Defaults that give the Contractor the right to terminate include:\n\nFailure to pay when due any undisputed portion of the Contract Sum under Section 10A.1 or any undisputed portion of a progress payment owing under a Change Order [Source 2, Section 19.4.2.2]\nAny other Developer Default for which the Contractor issues a Warning Notice under Section 19.2.9 and such Developer Default is not fully and completely cured within the applicable cure period, if any, set forth in Section 19.2.2 [Source 3, Section 20.3.2]\nIt can be inferred that the Contractor’s right to terminate is subject to certain conditions and cure periods, as outlined in the Agreement [Source 2, Section 19.4.2.2]. The exact scope and applicability of this right are defined in the provided sources [Source 2, Source 3].","Yes, the Contractor (Design-Build Contractor) has the right to terminate the contract if the Client (Developer) is in default.\n\nUnder Section 19.4.1 of the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf, the Contractor may terminate the Agreement and recover termination damages as set forth in Section 20.4, subject to the conditions in Section 20.9.\n\nThe Developer Defaults that give rise to this termination right include (per Section 19.3.1, referenced implicitly):\n\n- Failure to pay undisputed amounts due under the Contract Sum or Change Orders within 45 days of notice (Section 19.4.2.2).\n- Other material breaches not cured within 90 days of notice, or within 180 days if cure is diligently pursued and the breach is of a nature that requires more time (Section 19.3.1 and 19.4).\n\nAdditional remedies available to the Contractor include:\n\n- Suspension of Work (with limitations) for non-payment (Section 19.4.2.2).\n- Compensation for Losses incurred due to Developer Default (Section 19.4.2.1).\n- Other cumulative remedies under law or equity (Section 19.4.2.3 and 19.4.2.4).\n\nThese rights are subject to certain exceptions and limitations, including those in Sections 19.4.4 and 20.9.","Yes, the Design-Build Contractor has the right to terminate the contract if the Developer is in default. Under Section 20.4 of the DBC Executed Version, termination is permitted for:\n\nFailure to make payment (Section 19.3.1.1),\n\nBreach of covenant or other obligation (Section 19.3.1.3),\n\nFalse representations (Section 19.3.1.2), and\n\nTermination of the PPA for Developer Default (Section 19.3.1.4A)DBC Executed Version.\n\nTermination requires prior notice and expiration of applicable cure periods outlined in Section 19.3.2DBC Executed Version."
"Is there any compensation mechanism or right to claim for the Contractor in case of market shortage or unavailability of materials, equipment and/or labor, beyond the Contractor's control?","Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of a compensation mechanism or right to claim for the Contractor in case of market shortage or unavailability of materials, equipment, and/or labor beyond the Contractor’s control [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nHowever, Section 17.1.8 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2] mentions that Design-Build Contractor shall promptly notify Developer if it is unable, after using its diligent efforts, to procure the required Insurance Policy coverages in the global insurance and reinsurance markets. This suggests that the Contractor may have some recourse in case of unavailability of required coverages, but it is unclear if this applies to market shortages or unavailability of materials, equipment, and/or labor.\n\nIt can be inferred that the Contractor may be able to request relief or compensation under certain circumstances, such as changes in applicable standards or laws [Source 1], or through the mitigation of Relief Events [Source 3]. However, the exact scope and applicability of this compensation mechanism are not clearly defined in the provided sources [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nTherefore, it is unclear if there is a compensation mechanism or right to claim for the Contractor in case of market shortage or unavailability of materials, equipment, and/or labor beyond the Contractor’s control. More information would be needed to fully answer this question.","Yes, the contract provides a limited compensation mechanism for the Contractor in the event of market shortages or unavailability of materials, equipment, or labor, but only under specific conditions.\n\nSection 8.2.4 of the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf states that if the use or operation of Airspace or development of a Business Opportunity by IFA or others prevents the Contractor from performing its fundamental obligations or materially increases its costs, such impacts will be treated as a Relief Event. In that case, the Contractor is entitled to Equivalent Project Relief, which may include compensation or schedule relief.\n\nHowever, general market shortages or unavailability of materials, equipment, or labor—unless directly caused by a Relief Event defined in the contract—are not automatically compensable. The Contractor bears the risk of such occurrences unless they fall within the scope of a Relief Event under Article 15.\n\nTherefore, compensation is only available if the shortage or unavailability is linked to a qualifying Relief Event, such as government action, force majeure, or other defined events beyond the Contractor’s control.","Yes, there is a compensation mechanism if market shortages or unavailability of materials, equipment, or labor result from a Relief Event. Under Exhibit 17, Section 3.3 of the DBC, the Contractor may claim:\n\nEscalation Costs (Section 3.3.1): The difference between originally scheduled and actual costs for labor, materials, and equipment due to delay.\n\nStorage Costs (Section 3.3.2): Actual, reasonable costs to store materials delayed by a Relief Event (no markup allowed).\n\nEquipment Rental Escalation (Section 3.3.3): Escalated rental rates based on updated Blue Book rates.\n\nThese rights apply only when delays are caused by qualifying Relief Events under Article 15DBC Exhibits 2-31."
"Is there a Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board, or similar mechanism?","Based on the provided sources, there is a Dispute Resolution procedure in place. According to Section 19.6 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2], the Parties will use all reasonable endeavors for a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the date on which the Notice of Dispute is served to resolve the Dispute by amicable negotiation. If the Dispute is not resolved, it will be referred to the chief executive officer or equivalent of the Parties to resolve the Dispute by amicable negotiation.\n\nAdditionally, Section 19.6.2 [Source 2] mentions that if a Dispute is not resolved prior to the expiration of the ten-Business Day period, the Parties agree to submit the matter to settlement proceedings under the ADR Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”).\n\nIt can be inferred that while there is no explicit mention of a Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board, the Dispute Resolution procedure outlined in Section 19.6 [Source 2] serves as a similar mechanism for resolving disputes between the Parties. However, the exact scope and applicability of this mechanism are defined in the provided sources [Source 2].","There is no Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board mentioned in the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf. However, the contract includes a structured dispute resolution mechanism referred to as the “Dispute Resolution Procedures.”\n\nKey features include:\n\n- Disputes between the Developer and the Design-Build Contractor are resolved through procedures outlined in Article 19 and Article 19A.\n- Disputes involving IFA (Indiana Finance Authority) are resolved under the PPA’s Dispute Resolution Procedures, in which the Design-Build Contractor may participate.\n- The contract allows for declaratory relief and arbitration in certain cases, but does not establish a standing board like a Dispute Adjudication Board.\n\nThus, while there is a formal dispute resolution process, it does not involve a standing board mechanism.","The DBC does not establish a Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board. Instead, it outlines a multi-step dispute resolution process in Section 19.6, which includes:\n\nAmicable settlement through negotiation (Sections 19.6.1.1–1.2),\n\nMediation under ICC ADR Rules (Section 19.6.2), and\n\nBinding arbitration under ICC Rules in Chicago, IL (Section 19.6.3)DBC Executed Version.\n\nAdditionally, a non-binding partnering process with a partnering panel is described in Section 19.5DBC Executed Version."
How is the Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board formed?,"Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of a Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. However, Section 19.6 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2] outlines the Dispute Resolution Procedures, which include amicable negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted by three arbitrators (the “Tribunal”) pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) [Source 1]. The seat of the arbitration will be in Chicago, Illinois, and unless the Parties agree otherwise, all testimonial hearings shall be held in Chicago, Illinois [Source 1].\n\nIt can be inferred that while there is no explicit Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board, the Dispute Resolution Procedures outlined in Section 19.6 [Source 2] serve as a similar mechanism for resolving disputes between the Parties. The exact formation and composition of the arbitration tribunal are defined in the provided sources [Source 1, Source 2].","The DBC Executed Version 3.pdf does not establish a Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board.

Instead, the process relies on escalation and optional mediation, with final resolution through formal legal channels.","The DBC does not provide for a formal Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) or Dispute Resolution Board (DRB). Instead, it uses the following mechanisms:\n\nPartnering Panel (Section 19.5): A non-binding advisory group that may assist in dispute avoidance or resolution. Its formation, use, and structure are governed by a separate “Partnering Charter,” but it is not a formal adjudicatory bodyDBC Executed Version.\n\nDispute Resolution Procedures (Section 19.6): These include direct negotiation, mediation (under ICC ADR Rules), and binding arbitration (under ICC Rules), but do not involve a standing or project-specific dispute boardDBC Executed Version.\n\nThus, there is no DAB or DRB formation process in the contract."
"Are the decisions taken by the Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board immediately affordable? If a dispute persists after the Board's decision, what is the next step (is it Arbitration)?","Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of a Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. However, the Dispute Resolution procedure outlined in Section 19.6 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2] serves as a similar mechanism for resolving disputes between the Parties.\n\nThe decisions taken by the Parties through the Dispute Resolution procedure are not necessarily immediately enforceable. According to Section 19.6.1.1 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2], the Parties will use all reasonable endeavors to resolve the Dispute by amicable negotiation. If a Dispute is not resolved, it will be referred to the chief executive officer or equivalent of the Parties to resolve the Dispute by amicable negotiation [Source 2, Section 19.6.1.2].\n\nIf a dispute persists after the Parties’ attempts to resolve it through amicable negotiation, the next step is Mediation under the ADR Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) [Source 2, Section 19.6.2]. If the Dispute has not been settled pursuant to the said Rules within forty-five (45) days, the Dispute shall be finally settled by Arbitration [Source 3, Section 19.6.3.1]. The Arbitration will be conducted by three arbitrators (the “Tribunal”) pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC [Source 3, Section 19.6.3.1].\n\nIt can be inferred that the decisions taken by the Parties through the Dispute Resolution procedure are not immediately enforceable, and the next step in case of a persistent dispute is Mediation, followed by Arbitration if necessary [Source 2, Source 3].","There is no Dispute Adjudication Board or Dispute Resolution Board established in the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf.

Is there a Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee?,"Based on the provided sources, there is a Parent Guarantee in place. According to Section 17.4.1 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2], each DBC Parent Guarantor shall deliver to Developer a Parent Guarantee in the form contained in Exhibit 25, guaranteeing all obligations of Design-Build Contractor under the Agreement.\n\nThe DBC Parent Guarantors are defined as The Walsh Group Ltd. and VINCI Construction S.A.S. [Source 3]. The Parent Guarantees shall comply with the requirements of Section 17.4.1 of the PPA [Source 2].\n\nIt can be inferred that the Parent Guarantee provides a level of security for the Developer in case the Design-Build Contractor fails to meet its obligations under the Agreement [Source 2]. However, the exact terms and conditions of the Parent Guarantee are not explicitly stated in the provided sources.","Yes, there is a Parent Company Guarantee requirement in the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf.\n\nSection 17.5C.1 states that the Design-Build Contractor must provide Parent Guarantees in the form contained in Exhibit 25. These guarantees must be delivered concurrently with the execution of the Agreement and must guarantee all obligations of the Design-Build Contractor under the Agreement. The Parent Guarantees must also comply with the requirements of Section 17.4.1 of the PPA.\n\nThese guarantees are provided by the parent companies of the joint venture members (Walsh Construction Company and VINCI Construction Grands Projets) and serve as a financial backstop for the Contractor’s obligations.","Yes, there is a Parent Company Guarantee. Section 17.5C.1 of the DBC Executed Version requires the Design-Build Contractor to provide Parent Guarantees in the form included in Exhibit 25, guaranteeing all obligations under the agreementDBC Executed Version.

Does the Parent Company or Mother Company have the same rights as the Contractor for which it is a Guarantor?,"Based on the provided sources, the Parent Company Guarantee is an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of payment and performance [Source 1]. The Parent Guarantees shall comply with the requirements of Section 17.4.1 of the PPA [Source 3].\n\nThe Parent Company or Mother Company, as a Guarantor, has certain obligations and liabilities towards the Developer, but it does not have the same rights as the Contractor [Source 1]. The Guarantor’s obligations are limited to guaranteeing the performance of the Contractor’s obligations under the Agreement [Source 1].\n\nHowever, the Parent Company or Mother Company may have certain rights and defenses available to it in the event of a claim or demand made by the Developer [Source 1]. For example, the Guarantor may have the benefit of all rights, remedies, defenses, and limitations that the Design-Build Contractor is or would have been entitled to assert under the Design-Build Contract [Source 1].\n\nIn summary, while the Parent Company or Mother Company has certain obligations and liabilities as a Guarantor, it does not have the same rights as the Contractor, but may have certain rights and defenses available to it in specific circumstances [Source 1, Source 3].","No, the Parent Company (referred to as the “Parent Guarantor”) does not have the same rights as the Contractor under the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf.\n\nSection 17.5C.1 requires the Design-Build Contractor to provide Parent Guarantees in the form of Exhibit 25, guaranteeing all obligations of the Contractor under the Agreement. However, the Parent Guarantee is a financial backstop and does not confer operational rights or participation in the contract’s performance or decision-making.\n\nThe Parent Guarantor’s role is limited to guaranteeing performance and financial obligations. It does not assume the Contractor’s rights under the Agreement, such as rights to payment, dispute resolution participation, or termination.","No, the Parent Company (Guarantor) does not have the same rights as the Contractor.

Is the Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee limited to the Contractor's Overall Cap of Liability?,"Based on the provided sources, the Parent Guarantee is an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of payment and performance [Source 1]. The Parent Guarantees shall comply with the requirements of Section 17.4.1 of the PPA [Source 2].\n\nAccording to Section 19.1.1.20 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2], the Design-Build Contractor has incurred liabilities under this Agreement which reach the Liability Cap, unless the Design-Build Contractor has agreed to increase the Liability Cap to an amount mutually agreed by the Parties.\n\nIt can be inferred that the Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee is related to the Contractor’s Overall Cap of Liability, as the Parent Guarantee is triggered when the Design-Build Contractor’s liabilities reach the Liability Cap [Source 2]. However, the exact terms and conditions of the Parent Guarantee and its relationship to the Liability Cap are not explicitly stated in the provided sources.\n\nIt is mentioned in Section 17.4.1 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2] that the Parent Guarantees shall comply with the requirements of Section 17.4.1 of the PPA, but the details of this section are not provided in the retrieved sources. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether the Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee is limited to the Contractor’s Overall Cap of Liability without further information [Source 2].","No, the Parent Company Guarantee is not explicitly limited to the Contractor’s overall cap of liability.\n\nSection 17.5C of the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf allows the Developer to enforce the Parent Guarantee for any unpaid amounts or uncured defaults by the Design-Build Contractor, including Delay Liquidated Damages and other obligations. Section 17.5C.3 confirms that the Developer may make multiple calls on each Parent Guarantee.\n\nWhile Section 19.2.13A.1 establishes a general “Liability Cap” of 40% of the initial Contract Sum for the Design-Build Contractor, this cap does not expressly limit the enforceability or scope of the Parent Guarantee. The Parent Guarantee is a separate contractual obligation and may be called upon for any uncured default or unpaid amount, regardless of whether the liability cap has been reached, unless otherwise limited in the form of the guarantee itself (Exhibit 25).\n\nTherefore, unless the guarantee form in Exhibit 25 includes a specific cap, the Parent Guarantee is not automatically limited by the Contractor’s overall liability cap.","Yes, the Parent Company Guarantee is limited to the Contractor’s Overall Cap of Liability. As stated in Exhibit 25 (Form of Parent Guaranty), the guarantor’s liability is co-extensive with that of the Contractor, meaning it is subject to the same limitations, defenses, and liability caps—including the aggregate cap of 40% of the Contract Sum as specified in Section 19.2.13A.1 of the DBC Executed VersionDBC Exhibits 2-31DBC Executed Version."
When does the Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee expire?,"Based on the provided sources, the Parent Guarantee is an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of payment and performance [Source 2]. The Parent Guarantees shall comply with the requirements of Section 17.4.1 of the PPA [Source 2].\n\nAccording to Section 17.SC.3 of the DBC Executed Version [Source 2], Developer may make multiple calls and demands on each Parent Guarantee. However, there is no explicit mention of an expiration date for the Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee in the provided sources.\n\nIt can be inferred that the Parent Guarantee remains in effect until all obligations of the Design-Build Contractor under the Agreement have been fulfilled [Source 2]. However, the exact terms and conditions of the Parent Guarantee, including its expiration, are not explicitly stated in the provided sources. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm when the Parent Company Guarantee or Mother Company Guarantee expires without further information [Source 2].","The DBC Executed Version 3.pdf does not specify a fixed expiration date for the Parent Company Guarantee. However, the following provisions apply:\n\n- Section 17.5C.1 requires the Parent Guarantees to be delivered concurrently with the execution of the Agreement and to guarantee all obligations of the Design-Build Contractor under the Agreement.\n- Section 17.5C.3 states that the Developer may make multiple calls and demands on each Parent Guarantee.\n- There is no clause in Section 17.5C or elsewhere that limits the duration of the Parent Guarantee to a specific date or event such as Substantial Completion or Final Acceptance.\n\nTherefore, unless otherwise limited in the form of the guarantee itself (Exhibit 25), the Parent Company Guarantee remains in effect for the duration of the Contractor’s obligations under the Agreement and is not subject to automatic expiration.","The Parent Company Guarantee expires when all of the Contractor’s obligations under the DBC have been fully performed and discharged. Specifically, Exhibit 25 (Form of Parent Guaranty) states that the guaranty remains in full force and effect until the earlier of:\n\nThe date the Contractor’s obligations are fully satisfied, or\n\nA written release is issued by the Developer acknowledging discharge of the Guarantor’s obligationsDBC Exhibits 2-31.\n\nThere is no fixed date—the expiration is tied to fulfillment and release.\n"
Is there a Change in Law provision? Which changes in law are covered by it?,"Based on the provided sources, there is a Change in Law provision [Source 1].

This includes changes in federal, state, or local laws, as well as changes in the interpretation or application of such laws by any Governmental Entity after the Setting Date [Source 1].\n\nSpecifically, the Change in Law provision covers changes in laws related to environmental impacts, safety standards, and project standards, among others [Source 1]. However, changes in Adjustment Standards caused by new or revised statutes do not constitute a Change in Law [Source 2].\n\nIt can be inferred that the Change in Law provision is intended to address changes in laws that may affect the design, construction, or operation of the East End Crossing, and to provide a mechanism for resolving disputes related to such changes [Source 1, Source 2].","Yes, the DBC Executed Version 3.pdf includes a Change in Law provision.\n\nSection 25.13 addresses the impact of a Change in Law by stating that if any clause, provision, or part of the DBC Documents is ruled invalid due to a Change in Law, the parties must:\n\n- Promptly meet and negotiate a substitute provision that, to the greatest extent legally permissible, reflects the original intent of the parties, including adjustments to the Contractor’s compensation to account for any change in the D&C Work resulting from the invalidated portion.\n- If necessary, apply to the court or decision-maker for an interpretation of the invalidated portion to guide the negotiations.\n\nThis provision ensures that the contract remains enforceable and that the parties adjust their obligations and compensation in response to legal changes that affect the validity of the contract terms.","Yes, there is a Change in Law provision.

What is the Design Review and Approval Process? I need to know the different actors and stakeholders that are clearly identified in the Design Review and Approval Process.,"The Design Review and Approval Process involves several actors and stakeholders. According to Section 3.1.2 of Source 2, the Design-Build Contractor submits Submittals to IFA for review and approval. IFA has a specified period to act on these Submittals, which can be 28 days or 15 days depending on the type of Submittal [Source 2].\n\nThe stakeholders involved in this process include:\n\nDesign-Build Contractor: responsible for submitting Submittals [Source 2].\nIFA: responsible for reviewing and approving Submittals [Source 2].\nDeveloper: responsible for consulting with Design-Build Contractor and obtaining agreement on certain matters, such as the extension of review periods [Source 2].\nIt can be inferred that the Design Review and Approval Process is a critical component of the project, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned and that the design meets the required standards [Source 2]. However, the exact details of the process, such as the specific requirements for Submittals and the criteria for approval, are not explicitly stated in the provided sources.","The Design Review and Approval Process is detailed in Article 3 of the DBC Executed Version 4.pdf, particularly Sections 3.1 and 3.1A. The process involves multiple actors and stakeholders, each with defined roles:\n\n Key Stakeholders and Their Roles\n\n1. Design-Build Contractor\n - Prepares and submits design-related Submittals.\n - Responds to comments, objections, or disapprovals from IFA.\n - Revises and resubmits documents as necessary.\n - May prepare proposed Interpretive Engineering Decisions.\n\n2. Developer\n - Reviews and approves Submittals before they are sent to IFA.\n - Coordinates communication between the Design-Build Contractor and IFA.\n - Submits Key Submittals and Change Requests to IFA.\n - May participate in dispute resolution and partnering processes.\n\n3. Indiana Finance Authority (IFA)\n - Reviews, comments on, approves, or disapproves Submittals.\n - Has sole or good faith discretion over certain approvals.\n - May issue Directive Letters.\n - May conduct oversight, inspections, and audits.\n\n4.

Are deadlines and timeframes clearly specified in the Design Review and Approval Process?,"Based on the provided sources, deadlines and timeframes are specified in the Design Review and Approval Process [Source 2, Source 3].\n\nThe time periods for IFA to act on Submittals are as follows:\n\nTwenty-eight (28) days for most Submittals [Source 3, Section 3.1.2.1].\nFifteen (15) days for Submittals consisting of Design Documents or Construction Documents [Source 3, Section 3.1.2.2].\nIt is also stated that these time periods can be extended under certain circumstances, such as when IFA is in receipt of excess concurrent Submittals [Source 3, Section 3.1.2.4] or during any time that IFA is entitled to increase the level of its Oversight [Source 3, Section 3.1.2.6].\n\nAdditionally, IFA has agreed to endeavor to reasonably accommodate written requests from Developer for expedited action on specific Submittals [Source 3, Section 3.1.2.7].\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that deadlines and timeframes are clearly specified in the Design Review and Approval Process, with provisions for extensions and expedited action under certain circumstances [Source 2, Source 3].","Yes, deadlines and timeframes are clearly specified in the Design Review and Approval Process in the contract. The key provisions are:\n\n- IFA Review Periods: IFA has 15 to 28 days to review Submittals, depending on the type of document. For example, Design Documents and Construction Documents are subject to a 15-day review period unless otherwise agreed.\n\n- Developer Review: Design-Build Contractor must submit Key Submittals to Developer at least five business days before submitting them to IFA.\n\n- Relief Event Requests: Design-Build Contractor must submit a Relief Request within 30 days after Developer submits the initial Relief Event Notice to IFA.\n\n- Final Acceptance: IFA must issue a certificate of Final Acceptance or provide a notice of deficiencies within five days after the expiration of a 20-day review period following Developer’s second notice of Final Acceptance.\n\nThese timeframes are binding and structured to ensure timely review, response, and resolution among the parties involved.","Yes, deadlines and timeframes are clearly specified in the Design Review and Approval Process.

"If third parties other than OPG (the Client) and the Contractor are involved in the Design Review and Approval process, is their timeline for review and approval concurrent with the Client's timeline?","Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit information that directly states whether the timeline for review and approval of third parties other than OPG (the Client) and the Contractor is concurrent with the Client’s timeline [Source 2, Source 3].\n\nIt can be inferred that the Design Review and Approval Process involves IFA, Developer, and Design-Build Contractor, with specified time periods for IFA to act on Submittals [Source 2, Source 3]. However, the sources do not provide clear information on the involvement of third parties other than OPG and the Contractor in the Design Review and Approval process, or their timeline for review and approval [Source 2, Source 3].\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to confirm whether the timeline for review and approval of third parties is concurrent with the Client’s timeline without further information [Source 2, Source 3].","Yes, the contract specifies that third parties other than the Client (IFA) and the Contractor (Design-Build Contractor) may be involved in the Design Review and Approval Process, such as FHWA or other Governmental Entities. However, the timelines for their review and approval are not automatically concurrent with IFA’s timeline.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Section 3.4.1.5 states that nothing in the contract precludes or interferes with any review, inspection, or oversight by FHWA, the Department, or any regulatory agency with jurisdiction.\n- These third parties may conduct their own reviews and approvals as required by their agreements with IFA or applicable law.\n- The contract does not guarantee that their timelines align with IFA’s standard 15- or 28-day review periods.\n- Design-Build Contractor is responsible for compliance with all such third-party requirements and must coordinate accordingly.\n\nTherefore, while IFA’s review timelines are clearly defined, third-party timelines are independent and may vary.","Yes, if third parties (excluding OPG and the Contractor) are involved in the Design Review and Approval process, their review timeline is concurrent with IFA’s (the Client’s) timeline.

"If approval of a Design is not provided within the timeframe explicited for Design Review and Approval Process, can the Contractor proceed? Is there a provision for Tacit Approval?","Based on the provided sources, if approval of a Design is not provided within the timeframe explicitly stated for the Design Review and Approval Process, the Contractor may proceed, but with certain conditions [Source 1, Section 3.1.5.1].\n\nAccording to Section 3.1.5.1 of Source 1, if IFA delivers no comments, exceptions, objections, rejections, or disapprovals within the applicable time period, the Design-Build Contractor may proceed at its election and risk, without prejudice to IFA’s rights to later object or disapprove [Source 1].\n\nIt can be inferred that this provision implies a form of tacit approval, where the lack of response from IFA within the specified timeframe allows the Contractor to proceed with the design [Source 1]. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Contractor is fully protected from potential future objections or disapprovals from IFA [Source 1].\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that while there is a provision that allows the Contractor to proceed in the absence of a timely response from IFA, it is not a straightforward tacit approval, and the Contractor assumes the risk of potential future disputes or issues [Source 1].","No, the contract does not provide for tacit approval. If approval of a design is not provided within the specified timeframe, the contractor may not proceed based on silence or inaction alone.\n\nSection 3.1.5.1 of the contract states that if IFA (Indiana Finance Authority) fails to act within the applicable review period, the Design-Build Contractor may proceed at its own risk, but this does not constitute approval. There is no provision that equates inaction with approval.\n\nTherefore, the contractor must obtain explicit written approval before proceeding with any design elements that require such approval.","No, the Contractor cannot proceed if approval of a Design Submittal is not provided within the specified timeframe.

How are land parcels and Right of Way defined in the contract?,"Based on the provided sources, land parcels and Right of Way are defined in the contract as follows:\n\nProject Right of Way refers to the lands owned by or in the possession and control of IFA, or subject to a right of entry or access in favor of IFA, for the purpose of carrying out the Design-Build Contractor’s obligations under the Agreement [Source 1, Section 2.1.2].\nAdditional Properties refer to land parcels that are permanently needed to construct or maintain the East End Crossing, and are to be acquired by IFA on behalf of Developer [Source 2, Section 5.4.3].\nProject Specific Locations refer to temporary interests in property for specific locations, and are to be acquired by Design-Build Contractor [Source 2, Section 5.4.9].\nThe contract also mentions that IFA or KPTIA has completed or has agreed to undertake and complete the acquisition of Project Right of Way, except for Additional Properties and Project Specific Locations [Source 2, Section 5.4.2].\nIt can be inferred that the contract defines land parcels and Right of Way as specific areas of land that are necessary for the construction and maintenance of the East End Crossing, and outlines the responsibilities of IFA, Developer, and Design-Build Contractor in acquiring and managing these areas [Source 1, Source 2].","In the contract, the terms related to land parcels and Right of Way are defined as follows:\n\n Project Right of Way (Project ROW)\n- Defined as any real property (including all estates and interests in real property), improvements, and fixtures within the boundaries delineated in the ROW Maps found in the Reference Information Documents.\n- Includes all air space, surface rights, and subsurface rights within those boundaries.\n- Boundaries may be adjusted over time in accordance with the PPA Documents, including for Additional Properties.\n\n Additional Properties\n- Refers to properties that are:\n - Outside the original Project Right of Way boundaries, and\n - Either added permanently for East End Crossing-related purposes or temporarily for use as Project Specific Locations.\n\n Site\n- Includes the Project Right of Way and any temporary rights or interests acquired by the Developer in connection with the East End Crossing or Utility Adjustments.\n- Also includes Project Specific Locations but excludes Toll Collection System Locations.\n\nThese definitions establish the spatial and legal scope of the land and access rights relevant to the project.","Land parcels and Right of Way (ROW) are defined in Exhibit 1 of the DBC Executed Version as follows:\n\nProject Right of Way: All real property, including easements and airspace, needed for design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the East End CrossingDBC Exhibit 1.\n\nAdditional Properties: Properties outside the ROW boundaries that are added for permanent or temporary East End Crossing useDBC Exhibit 1.\n\nAirspace: The vertical column above/below the ROW not required for project fulfillmentDBC Exhibit 1."
Does the contract specify clear dates of availability for each land parcel?,"Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of clear dates of availability for each land parcel [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. The contract does mention that IFA or KPTIA has completed or has agreed to undertake and complete the acquisition of Project Right of Way, except for Additional Properties and Project Specific Locations [Source 2, Section 5.4.2]. However, it does not provide specific dates for the availability of each land parcel.\n\nIt can be inferred that the contract assumes that the necessary land parcels will be available for the project, but it does not provide a detailed schedule for their availability [Source 1, Source 2]. The contract does outline the responsibilities of IFA, Developer, and Design-Build Contractor in acquiring and managing the land parcels, but it does not specify clear dates for their availability [Source 2, Section 5.4.3, Source 3, Section 5.10.1].","The contract does not specify clear, individual dates of availability for each land parcel. However, it defines the scope and structure of land access through the following provisions:\n\n1. Project Right of Way (ROW)\nDefined as all real property, improvements, and fixtures within the boundaries shown in the ROW Maps (referenced in the Reference Information Documents).\nIncludes airspace, surface, and subsurface rights.\nBoundaries may be adjusted over time in accordance with the PPA Documents.\n2. Additional Properties\nRefers to properties outside the original ROW that are added either permanently or temporarily for project-related use.\n3. Site Access\nThe Design-Build Contractor is granted a “Project Right of Entry” to access the ROW and other lands controlled by IFA or subject to access rights.\nThis access is subject to conditions such as obtaining necessary Governmental Approvals and compliance with applicable laws and safety procedures.\n4. Availability Timing\nThe contract does not list parcel-specific availability dates.\nInstead, it provides that access is granted upon satisfaction of certain conditions (e.g., issuance of NTP1 or NTP2, permit approvals).\nThe Developer and IFA are responsible for providing access, but no schedule of parcel-by-parcel availability is included in the contract text.\nIn summary, while the contract defines the ROW and access rights, it does not assign or list specific availability dates for individual land parcels.","The contract does not provide a parcel-by-parcel list of specific availability dates. However, it states that IFA or KPTIA is responsible for acquiring the Project Right of Way and completing acquisition in accordance with Section 21 of the PPA and Attachment 21-1 of the Technical Provisions. These documents govern the timing and method of ROW acquisition. The Design-Build Contractor bears time and cost risk for delays in acquisition of Additional Properties, except where caused solely by an IFA ChangeDBC Executed Version."
Does the contract specify clear dates of return for each land parcel?,"Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of clear dates of return for each land parcel [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].

It can be inferred that the same applies to the return of land parcels.\n\n","The contract does not specify clear, individual dates of return for each land parcel. However, it does establish general provisions for the return of land and Right of Way:\n\n General Return Obligation\n- Upon termination of the contract, or as soon thereafter as possible, the Design-Build Contractor must relinquish and surrender all management, custody, and control of:\n - The East End Crossing,\n - The Project Right of Way, and\n - The Project Right of Entry.\n\nThis obligation is outlined in Section 20.7.3 of the DBC Executed Version 4.pdf.\n\n Conditions of Return\n- The return must be in at least the condition required by the Handback Requirements.\n- The Contractor must ensure that all persons and entities claiming under or through it also vacate the property.\n- The Project Right of Way must be free and clear of any liens or encumbrances created or permitted by the Contractor.\n\n No Parcel-Specific Dates\n- The contract does not provide a schedule or list of specific return dates for individual land parcels.\n\nIn summary, while the contract mandates the return of land and Right of Way upon termination, it does not assign specific return dates for each parcel.","The contract does not specify clear dates of return for each land parcel.

Does the Client have access to all land parcels required for the project?,"Based on the provided sources, it can be inferred that the Client, IFA, has access to most of the land parcels required for the project [Source 1, Section 5.4.2, Source 2, Section 2.1.2]. The contract states that IFA or KPTIA has completed or has agreed to undertake and complete the acquisition of Project Right of Way, except for Additional Properties and Project Specific Locations [Source 1, Section 5.4.2].\n\nHowever, the contract also mentions that Design-Build Contractor shall be responsible for acquiring rights in Project Specific Locations [Source 1, Section 5.4.9] and that IFA is not obligated to approve a request for acquisition of any other Additional Property where it would materially adversely affect political, community, or public relations [Source 1, Section 5.4.4].\n\nIt is not explicitly stated that the Client has access to all land parcels required for the project, as there may be some parcels that are still in the process of being acquired or where access is subject to certain conditions [Source 1, Section 5.4.2, Source 2, Section 2.1.2]. Therefore, it can be inferred that while the Client has access to most of the land parcels, there may be some exceptions or limitations [Source 1, Source 2].","The contract does not explicitly state that the Client (IFA or Developer) has access to all land parcels required for the project at the outset.

Standard Warranty Period: The general Defect Liability Period, referred to as the “Warranty Period,” is 24 months after the Substantial Completion Date (Exhibit 1, definition of “Warranty Period”).\n\n2. Latent Defects: For Latent Defects, the liability period is extended to a minimum of 10 years from the Substantial Completion Date, in accordance with Indiana’s statute of repose (Exhibit 1, definition of “Latent Defect Period”).\n\n3. Corrective Work: If Corrective Work is performed during the Warranty Period, the warranty for that specific work is extended, and the Liquid Security must remain in place for the duration of the extended warranty (Section 17.2.2A.3).\n\nThese provisions define both the standard and extended durations during which the Design-Build Contractor remains liable for defects, with specific limits based on the nature of the defect.","Yes, there are limits to the Defect Liability Period in the contract:\n\nThe General Warranty Period is limited to 1 year from DB Final Acceptance (Section 11.1.2), after which the Contractor is no longer obligated to correct non-latent defects.\n\nThe Latent Defect Period is capped at 10 years from DB Final Acceptance (Section 11.1.3), beyond which the Contractor has no further liability for latent defects.\n\nThese periods represent absolute outer limits on the Contractor’s defect correction obligationsDBC Executed Version."
What are the contractor's warranty obligations under this contract?,"Based on the provided sources, the contractor’s warranty obligations under this contract are as follows:\n\nThe Design-Build Contractor shall obtain from all Contractors representations, warranties, guarantees, and obligations with respect to design, materials, workmanship, equipment, tools, and supplies furnished by such Contractors [Source 1, Section 5.11.1].\nThe warranty period for Contractors shall be for a period of not less than one (1) year [Source 1, Section 5.11.1].\nThe Design-Build Contractor warrants that materials and equipment furnished under the Agreement shall be free of Defects and of good quality and new [Source 2, Section 5.2A.1.1].\nThe Design-Build Contractor warrants that the D&C Work shall meet all of the requirements of the Agreement [Source 2, Section 5.2A.1.1].\nThe Design-Build Contractor shall be liable for the correction or remedy of Defects that are notified to Design-Build Contractor or that Design-Build Contractor otherwise gains Design-Build Contractor Knowledge of within the Warranty Period [Source 3, Section 5.2A.3.1].\nThe Design-Build Contractor shall enforce any and all warranties obtained from its Contractors on behalf of Developer, IFA, Utility Owners, and any third parties for whom D&C Work is being performed [Source 2, Section 5.2A.1.4].\nIt can be inferred that these warranty obligations are intended to ensure that the D&C Work meets the requirements of the Agreement and that the materials and equipment used are of good quality and free of defects [Source 1, Source 2]. However, the exact scope and details of these warranty obligations may require further information to provide a definitive answer [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].","The contractor's warranty obligations under the Design-Build Contract (DBC Executed Version 5.pdf) include the following:\n\n1. Standard of Performance \n - The contractor must carry out its obligations in accordance with the DBC and PPA Documents and Good Industry Practice for work of similar scope and scale (Section 7.3.2.3).\n\n2.

What explicit Waiver of Rights or Waiver of Claim provisions exist in this contract?,"Based on the provided sources, the contract includes several explicit Waiver of Rights or Waiver of Claim provisions.\n\nThe contract states that “no waiver of any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement or the other DBC Documents shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the obligee Party” [Source 1].\nIt also mentions that “any waiver by Developer of any breach or failure to enforce any of the terms, covenants, conditions or other provisions of the DBC Documents at any time shall not in any way limit or waive that Party’s right thereafter to enforce or compel strict compliance with every term, covenant, condition or other provision” [Source 1].\nAdditionally, the contract includes a provision that states “Guarantor hereby waives: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) notice of any advances made by Developer in connection with the Design-Build Contract; © notice of any change in the corporate or organizational status, the constitution, the business, the objects or the shareholders, members or partners of Design-Build Contractor or Developer” [Source 3].\nThe contract also states that “Guarantor shall not be subrogated to any of the rights of Developer or its successors, assigns or other permitted transferee beneficiaries under the Design-Build Contract by reason of any of the provisions of this Guaranty” [Source 3].\nThese provisions suggest that the contract includes explicit Waiver of Rights or Waiver of Claim provisions, which are intended to protect the parties’ rights and limit their liabilities under the contract [Source 1, Source 3].","The DBC Executed Version 6 contract includes explicit waiver of claims provisions, particularly in the context of final payment and dispute resolution. Key provisions include:\n\nFinal Payment Waiver: The Contractor’s acceptance of final payment constitutes a full waiver of any and all claims against the Developer or IFA, except for those previously submitted in writing and identified as unsettled at the time of final payment. This is a standard clause to ensure closure of financial obligations and prevent post-completion claims unless preserved in writing.\n\nNo Waiver by Conduct: The contract typically includes language stating that failure to enforce any provision or delay in enforcement does not constitute a waiver of rights. This preserves the Developer’s ability to enforce contract terms even if not immediately acted upon.\n\nWaiver of Consequential Damages: The Contractor waives claims for consequential damages, except in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or specific indemnity obligations (Section 19.2.12).\n\nThese clauses collectively limit the Contractor’s ability to assert claims after certain milestones and protect the Developer from unexpected liabilities.","Yes, the contract includes explicit Waiver of Rights or Waiver of Claim provisions:\n\nRelief Events: The Contractor must provide a full, unconditional, irrevocable waiver and release of all other claims, losses, or rights to relief associated with a Relief Event (not subject to dispute) in order to receive compensation for that Relief Event (Section 15.14)DBC Executed Version.\n\nTermination: Upon termination and payment, the Contractor waives all claims against the Developer except those asserted in accordance with Section 19.6.3.1 and unresolved at the time of payment (Section 20.9.3)DBC Executed Version."
Does the contract contain language that causes the Contractor to waive compensation or indemnification rights?,"Based on the provided sources, the contract does contain language that causes the Contractor to waive certain compensation or indemnification rights.\n\nThe contract states that “Design-Build Contractor unconditionally and irrevocably waives the right to any claim against Developer for any monetary compensation, schedule relief or other relief with respect to Relief Events, except to the extent specifically provided in this Article 15 or otherwise as specifically provided in this Agreement” [Source 2].\nAdditionally, the contract mentions that “Design-Build Contractor waives all rights against the Indemnified Parties, for any claims to the extent covered and paid by insurance obtained pursuant to this Section 17.1, except such rights as they may have to the proceeds of such insurance” [Source 1, Section 17.1.1B].\nIt can be inferred that these provisions are intended to limit the Contractor’s rights to claim compensation or indemnification in certain circumstances [Source 1, Source 2]. However, the exact scope and details of these waiver provisions may require further information to provide a definitive answer [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].","Yes, the contract contains multiple provisions where the Contractor (Design-Build Contractor) waives compensation or indemnification rights:\n\n1. Waiver of Offset Rights \n - Section 19.4.3.2 states that, except as specifically provided, the Contractor irrevocably waives and releases any rights of offset or deduction, whether available at law or in equity.\n\n2. Limitation on Remedies \n - Section 19.4.4.1 limits Developer’s liability for consequential damages, and the Contractor releases Developer from such liability, except in specific cases (e.g., fraud, gross negligence, or express obligations under the contract).\n\n3.

Lien Waiver \n - Section 7.3.2.18 confirms that the Contractor waives any right or claim to a lien or encumbrance on the project for non-payment.\n\nThese clauses collectively limit the Contractor’s ability to claim additional compensation or remedies beyond what is expressly provided in the contract.","Yes, the contract contains language that causes the Contractor to waive compensation or indemnification rights in certain situations:\n\nRelief Events (Section 15.14): To receive compensation for a Relief Event, the Contractor must submit a claim and simultaneously provide a full, unconditional, irrevocable waiver of any other claims or rights arising from that event not included in the claimDBC Executed Version.\n\nTermination (Section 20.9.3): Upon receiving final termination payment, the Contractor waives all other claims against the Developer, except those properly asserted and unresolved under the dispute resolution procedureDBC Executed Version.\n\nThese provisions limit further recovery beyond what is expressly claimed and allowed."
Are there provisions in the contract that cause the Contractor to lose the right to claim for additional time or costs?,"Based on the provided sources, there are provisions in the contract that may cause the Contractor to lose the right to claim for additional time or costs.\n\nThe contract states that “Design-Build Contractor unconditionally and irrevocably waives the right to any claim against Developer for any monetary compensation, schedule relief or other relief with respect to Relief Events, except to the extent specifically provided in this Article 15 or otherwise as specifically provided in this Agreement” [Source 2].\nAdditionally, the contract mentions that “no award of compensation or damages shall be duplicative” [Source 2], which may limit the Contractor’s ability to claim for additional time or costs.\nIt can be inferred that these provisions are intended to limit the Contractor’s rights to claim for additional time or costs in certain circumstances [Source 2].\nHowever, the exact scope and details of these provisions may require further information to provide a definitive answer [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].","Yes, the contract contains provisions that can cause the Contractor to lose the right to claim additional time or costs under certain conditions:\n\n1. Waiver and Release Requirement (Section 15.14) \n - As a condition to receiving compensation or relief for a Relief Event, the Contractor may be required to execute a full, unconditional, irrevocable waiver and release of any other claims or rights to relief associated with that event.\n\n2. Mitigation Obligations (Section 15.15.1) \n - The Contractor must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences of a Relief Event. If impacts could have been avoided through re-sequencing, re-scheduling, or cost-effective work-around measures, the Contractor is not entitled to claim additional time or costs.\n\n3. Contractor Fault (Section 15.15.1) \n - If the Relief Event occurred due to the Contractor’s negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct, breach of contract, or violation of law or approvals, the Contractor loses the right to claim compensation, time extensions, or other relief.\n\n4. Failure to Comply with Change Order Procedures (Article 16) \n - Article 16 sets forth exclusive procedures for obtaining Change Orders.

"Are bonds and securities included in the Aggregate/Overall Cap of Liability, and how does the cap compare to their combined value?","Based on the provided sources, the Aggregate/Overall Cap of Liability is not explicitly defined. However, the contract states that “the aggregate liability of the Surety under this Performance Bond, to any or all of the obligees, as their interests may appear, is limited to the penal sum of the Performance Bond” [Source 1].\n\nIt can be inferred that the Performance Bond is a significant component of the contract, and its value is likely to be a substantial portion of the overall liability [Source 1, Source 2]. However, the exact value of the Performance Bond is not specified in the provided sources.\n\nThe contract also mentions that the required limits for Commercial General Liability/Completed Operations are outlined in Table 14 [Source 2], but the table is not provided.\n\nIt is unclear how the cap compares to the combined value of bonds and securities, as the values of these components are not explicitly stated in the provided sources [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the available information.","Yes, the contract includes an Aggregate Cap of Liability and clarifies how it relates to bonds and securities:\n\n Aggregate/Overall Cap of Liability\n- The Design-Build Contractor’s total liability to the Developer is capped at 40% of the initial Contract Sum (Section 19.2.13A.1).\n- This cap includes Delay Liquidated Damages and other liabilities unless specifically excluded.\n\n Exceptions to the Liability Cap\nThe cap does not apply to:\n- Amounts recovered through insurance or that would have been recoverable if required insurance had been maintained.\n- Third-party claims (excluding IFA or Lenders) related to the D&C Work.\n- Claims arising from abandonment, willful default, misconduct, or fraud.\n- Indemnities for third-party claims, personal injury, death, or intellectual property.\n- Statutory fines, penalties, and related compliance costs.\n- Amounts repaid to the Developer and later recovered by the Contractor.\n\n Bonds and Securities\nThe contract requires the following:\n- Performance Bond and Payment Bond (Section 17.2.1).\n- Liquid Security in the form of a letter of credit or other approved security:\n - 7.5% of the Contract Sum until Substantial Completion.\n - 3.75% from Substantial Completion to Final Acceptance.\n - 1.5% from Final Acceptance to the end of the Warranty Period.\n - May increase to 200% of the value of outstanding Corrective Work.\n\n Comparison\n- The combined value of required bonds and securities (up to 7.5% of the Contract Sum) is significantly lower than the Aggregate Cap of Liability (40% of the Contract Sum).\n- These instruments serve as partial financial assurance but do not limit the Developer’s right to recover up to the full liability cap, or beyond it in the case of the specified exceptions.\n\nIn summary, while bonds and securities provide important financial backing, they are not included in or capped by the Aggregate Cap of Liability and serve distinct purposes within the contract’s risk and performance framework.","No, bonds and securities are not included in the Aggregate/Overall Cap of Liability. According to Section 19.2.13A.1 of the DBC Executed Version, the cap applies to the Contractor’s total liability for claims but does not limit IFA’s ability to draw on security instruments such as:\n\nPerformance Bond (100% of Contract Sum),\n\nPayment Bond (100%), and\n\nLiquid Security (up to 7.5%, then reduced over time).\n\nThe cap itself is 40% of the initial Contract Sum, which is significantly lower than the combined value of bonds and security instrumentsDBC Executed VersionDBC Executed Version."
What are the primary payment mechanisms and conditions specified in this contract?,"The primary payment mechanisms and conditions specified in this contract are as follows:\n\nThe Developer shall pay to the Design-Build Contractor $763,000,000 (the “Contract Sum”) in installments subject to the terms and conditions of Article 10A [Source 2].\nThe Construction Payment Schedule sets out the Construction Payment Items and the amount of the Contract Sum allocated to each such Construction Payment Item [Source 2].\nThe Design-Build Contractor shall be entitled to the Construction Payment Amount in respect of each Construction Payment Item completed in accordance with the Agreement [Source 2].\nThe Design-Build Contractor may invoice the Developer in accordance with Section 10A.2, and the Developer must pay the Design-Build Contractor in accordance with Section 10A.4 on a monthly basis [Source 2].\nThe payment amount shall be equal to the proportion (as determined by the Lenders’ Technical Advisor) of the value of the Construction Payment Item completed during the immediately preceding month [Source 2].\nIt can be inferred that the payment mechanisms are designed to provide a regular and predictable flow of funds to the Design-Build Contractor, subject to the completion of specific construction payment items [Source 2].

"Does the contract provide for payment advances upon Commercial Close or contract signature, and what are the terms?","Based on the provided sources, the contract does not explicitly mention payment advances upon Commercial Close or contract signature [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that “Design-Build Contractor shall make no payments to Affiliates for work or services in advance of provision of such work or services, except for reasonable mobilization payments or other payments consistent with arm’s length, competitive transactions of similar scope” [Source 1]. This suggests that some advance payments may be allowed under certain circumstances, but the specific terms and conditions are not clearly stated.\n\nIt can be inferred that the contract may allow for some form of payment advance, but the exact terms and conditions are not explicitly defined in the provided sources [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. Therefore, it is unclear what the specific terms of such payment advances would be.","The contract does not provide for any advance payments upon Commercial Close or contract signature. Instead, the payment mechanism is based on monthly progress payments tied to completed work:\n\n Key Payment Terms:\n1. No Advance Payment:\n - There is no provision for an upfront or mobilization payment at Commercial Close or contract execution.\n\n2. Monthly Construction Payments (Section 10A.2):\n - Payments are made monthly based on the value of completed Construction Payment Items, as determined by the Lenders’ Technical Advisor.\n - The contractor must submit a detailed Statement with supporting documentation, including declarations regarding liens, defaults, and compliance with Governmental Approvals.\n\n3. Conditions Precedent to Payment (Section 17.2.2):\n - The contractor must provide monthly certifications and lien waivers from itself and its subcontractors.\n - Certified payrolls must be submitted to demonstrate compliance with prevailing wage laws.\n\n4. Security Requirements (Section 17.2.1):\n - Before any construction work begins, the contractor must provide a Payment Bond and Performance Security in the same form and amount as required under the PPA.\n\nIn summary, the contract is structured to ensure that payments are made only after work is completed and verified, with no provision for advance or mobilization payments at the outset.","Yes, the contract provides for a mobilization payment upon Commercial Close.

"What is the payment frequency and structure (milestone-based, monthly, or annual) in this contract?","The payment frequency and structure in this contract are as follows:\n\nThe Developer shall pay to the Design-Build Contractor $763,000,000 (the “Contract Sum”) in installments subject to the terms and conditions of Article 10A [Source 2].\nThe payment structure is based on Construction Payment Items, with the Design-Build Contractor entitled to the Construction Payment Amount in respect of each Construction Payment Item completed in accordance with the Agreement [Source 2].\nThe payment frequency is monthly, with the Developer paying the Design-Build Contractor on a monthly basis the amount of the Construction Payment Amount in relation to Construction Payment Items (if any) completed or a proportionate amount of a Construction Payment Amount equal to the proportion (as determined by the Lenders’ Technical Advisor) of the value of such Construction Payment Item completed during the immediately preceding month [Source 2].\nAdditionally, the contract mentions Milestone Payments, which are paid by IFA to the Developer upon achievement of specific milestones, and the Developer may deduct the amount of such Milestone Payment from the maximum aggregate amount of Construction Payments allowed at such time if a milestone is not achieved [Source 1].\nIt can be inferred that the payment structure is a combination of milestone-based and monthly payments, with the monthly payments based on the completion of Construction Payment Items [Source 1, Source 2].","The payment frequency and structure in the Design-Build Contract (DBC Executed Version 5.pdf) is as follows:\n\n Payment Frequency:\n- Monthly: Payments are made on a monthly basis based on the value of work completed in the preceding month.\n\n Payment Structure:\n- Milestone-Based: The contract sum of $763,000,000 is divided into Construction Payment Items, each with an assigned value (Construction Payment Amount) as detailed in the Construction Payment Schedule (Exhibit 29).\n- Progress-Based: For each Construction Payment Item, the contractor may invoice for either:\n - The full amount upon completion of the item, or\n - A proportionate amount based on the percentage of the item completed, as determined by the Lenders' Technical Advisor.\n\n Conditions:\n- The contractor must submit a monthly Statement (Exhibit 30) detailing completed work and supporting documentation.\n- The Statement must include declarations regarding:\n - Absence or resolution of construction liens.\n - Status of defaults.\n - Compliance with Governmental Approvals.\n - Environmental compliance.\n\nThis structure ensures that payments are tied to verified progress and compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements.","The contract uses a milestone-based and monthly payment structure:\n\nMilestone-Based Payments: Payments are tied to specific construction milestones defined in Exhibit 29, payable upon achievement and approval (Section 10A.1.2)DBC Executed Version.\n\nMonthly Payment Applications: The Contractor submits monthly invoices with detailed documentation for review and payment by the Developer and IFA (Section 10A.2)DBC Executed Version.\n\nThere are no annual payments—the structure is primarily monthly with milestone triggers."
Is the Contractor required to provide funding or financial participation under this contract?,"Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of the Contractor being required to provide funding or financial participation under this contract [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that the Developer shall pay to the Design-Build Contractor $763,000,000 (the “Contract Sum”) in installments subject to the terms and conditions of Article 10A [Source 2]. This suggests that the Contractor will receive payment from the Developer, but it does not imply that the Contractor is required to provide funding or financial participation.\n\nIt can be inferred that the contract may require the Contractor to manage its own finances and resources to complete the project, but the exact terms and conditions of any potential financial participation are not clearly stated [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. Therefore, it is unclear if the Contractor is required to provide funding or financial participation under this contract.","The Design-Build Contract (DBC Executed Version 5.pdf) does not require the Contractor to provide direct funding or financial participation in the project. However, the Contractor is responsible for certain reimbursable costs and financial obligations, including:\n\n1. Reimbursement for Governmental Approvals:\n - The Contractor must reimburse the Developer for costs incurred by IFA in assisting with Governmental Approvals necessary for the D&C Work, especially when such approvals are obtained or modified by the Contractor (Section 4.3.8).\n\n2. Litigation and Environmental Approvals:\n - The Contractor is responsible for its own legal expenses and may be required to assist in defending Environmental Approvals, at its own cost (Section 4.3.10).\n\n3. Utility Adjustments:\n - The Contractor must comply with federal regulations (23 CFR Part 645) to ensure eligibility for federal reimbursement of Utility Adjustment costs. However, the Contractor acknowledges that it will not be eligible for FHWA reimbursement directly (Section 5.5.5 of the PPA, referenced).\n\n4. No Joint Venture or Financial Control:\n - The contract explicitly states that the relationship between the Developer and the Contractor is not a partnership or joint venture, and the Developer has no control over the Contractor’s financial decisions (Section 25.4.2).\n\nIn summary, while the Contractor is not required to provide capital or financing for the project, it does bear financial responsibility for certain project-related costs and risks, particularly those it initiates or controls.","No, the Contractor is not required to provide funding or financial participation under this contract. As stated in Section 10A.1.4 of the DBC Executed Version, the Developer is responsible for making all contract payments, and the Contractor’s compensation is limited to those payments.

This suggests that IFA has some discretion in approving or rejecting changes.\n\nHowever, it is also stated that Design-Build Contractor shall have no obligation to perform any work within certain exceptions unless on terms mutually acceptable to Developer and Design-Build Contractor [Source 3]. This implies that the Contractor may not be required to accept unilateral instructions or approvals from the Client.\n\nIt can be inferred that while IFA has some authority to approve or reject changes, the Contractor may not be required to accept unilateral instructions or approvals from the Client, and that mutual agreement between the parties may be required in certain cases [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nThe exact terms and conditions of the Client’s authority to instruct or approve variations or changes may require further information to provide a definitive answer [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].","No, the Client (IFA or Developer) cannot unilaterally instruct or approve variations or changes that the Contractor must accept under all circumstances.\n\nAccording to Section 16.1.1.2 of the Design-Build Contract (DBC Executed Version 5.pdf):\n\n- The Contractor is not obligated to perform any work resulting from a Change Order issued by IFA if the change:\n - Is not in compliance with applicable laws,\n - Would contravene an existing Governmental Approval that cannot be corrected,\n - Would render a material insured risk uninsurable (unless IFA agrees to self-insure), or\n - Is not technically feasible.\n\n- In such cases, the Contractor is only required to perform the work if the terms are mutually acceptable to both the Developer and the Contractor.\n\nTherefore, while IFA may issue Change Orders and initiate variations, the Contractor retains the right to reject changes that fall within these exceptions unless mutually agreed terms are reached. This ensures that significant or impractical changes cannot be imposed unilaterally.","Yes, the Client (IFA) can unilaterally instruct variations through a Directive Letter if agreement on a Change Order cannot be reached. According to Section 16.1.3 of the DBC Executed Version, IFA may issue a Directive Letter requiring the Contractor to proceed with the instructed change, even without mutual agreement.\n\nThe Contractor must comply with the directive but may later seek cost or schedule adjustments through the dispute resolution process if it disagrees with the termsDBC Executed Version."
Does the contract allow variations or changes to be amended after provisional acceptance or approval?,"Based on the provided sources, it appears that the contract does allow for variations or changes to be made after provisional acceptance or approval, but the extent of this allowance is not entirely clear [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nAccording to Section 1A.2.1 of the Design-Build Contract, Developer may amend any provision of any Principal Developer Document, subject to certain conditions [Source 1]. This suggests that changes can be made after provisional acceptance or approval.\n\nAdditionally, Section 16.2.5 of the PPA, as referenced in Source 3, states that the Contract Sum shall be reduced by any payments made by Developer to IFA, or any reduction in payments otherwise payable by IFA to Developer, in accordance with Section 16.2.5 of the PPA [Source 3]. This implies that changes can be made after provisional acceptance or approval, and that the contract sum can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nHowever, it is also stated that certain minor changes without significant cost savings or revenue benefits may be approved in writing by IFA as Deviations, and in such event, shall not require a Change Order [Source 3]. This suggests that not all changes may be allowed after provisional acceptance or approval.\n\nIt can be inferred that the contract may allow for variations or changes to be amended after provisional acceptance or approval, but the exact terms and conditions of this allowance may require further information to provide a definitive answer [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].","Yes, the contract allows for variations or changes to be amended after provisional acceptance or approval. Specifically:\n\n- Under Section 16.1 of the contract (referencing the PPA), IFA retains the right to issue Change Orders at any time, including after provisional acceptance, to alter or reduce the scope of the Design and Construction (D&C) Work. These changes may include modifications to the Technical Provisions or applicable standards, provided they do not violate laws, existing Governmental Approvals, or technical feasibility (Section 16.1.1.1).\n\n- Section 5.2.5 clarifies that if changes are necessary to rectify errors in the Technical Provisions after the Effective Date, such changes are not grounds for a claim unless the issue was unknown and not reasonably discoverable before the affected work began.\n\n- Section 5.2.6 and 5.2.7 further confirm that changes to standards or specifications, including Safety Standards, may be adopted after the Setting Date and must be complied with for any D&C Work undertaken after Substantial Completion.\n\nTherefore, the contract explicitly permits post-approval changes through formal Change Orders, subject to defined procedures and limitations.","Yes, the contract allows variations or changes to be amended after provisional acceptance or approval. Section 16.4 of the DBC Executed Version states that executed Change Orders may be amended, provided the amendment is in writing and signed by both parties. This applies regardless of prior approvals or acceptance, allowing for adjustments post-approval if both IFA and the Contractor agreeDBC Executed Version."
"Does this contract interface, integrate, or interact with other contracts or third-party entities?","Based on the provided sources, it appears that the contract does interface, integrate, or interact with other contracts or third-party entities [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nThe contract references the PPA Documents, DBC Documents, and applicable Law, indicating that it interacts with other contracts or agreements [Source 1, Source 3].\nThe contract also mentions Utility Agreements and Governmental Approvals, suggesting that it interfaces with third-party entities such as utility owners and governmental entities [Source 1].\nAdditionally, the contract identifies Indemnified Parties, including IFA, as third-party beneficiaries, which implies that the contract interacts with these entities [Source 3].\nThe contract also references the Secured Parties, who are intended third-party beneficiaries of the Agreement [Source 2].\nIt can be inferred that the contract is part of a larger network of agreements and interactions with various third-party entities, including contractors, utility owners, governmental entities, and secured parties [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. However, the exact nature and extent of these interactions may require further information to provide a definitive answer.","Yes, the contract explicitly interfaces, integrates, and interacts with other contracts and third-party entities in several ways:\n\n1. Related Transportation Facilities:\n - Section 8.1 requires the Design-Build Contractor to ensure compatibility, integration, and transition with Related Transportation Facilities. This includes coordination with third parties that own, manage, operate, or maintain such facilities.\n - IFA may assist in obtaining cooperation from these third parties, and the Design-Build Contractor must reimburse IFA for reasonable costs incurred in doing so (Section 8.1.5).\n\n2. Third-Party Agreements:\n - Section 4.6 prohibits the Design-Build Contractor from entering into agreements with third parties (e.g., Governmental Entities, Utilities, property owners) that purport to bind IFA or the Developer without prior written approval. This ensures that third-party interactions do not create unintended obligations for IFA or the Developer.\n\n3. Traffic Management and Access:\n - Section 8.1.6 acknowledges that IFA and the Department retain the right to conduct traffic management activities on their facilities, which may affect the project.\n\n4. Business Opportunities and Reserved Rights:\n - Section 8.2 outlines IFA’s rights to develop Airspace and Business Opportunities related to the project. If such developments materially impact the Design-Build Contractor’s obligations or costs, they may be treated as Relief Events.\n\n5. Community and Public Engagement:\n - Section 4.7 requires the Design-Build Contractor to contribute to the Public Involvement Plan, which includes outreach and communication with the public and stakeholders.\n\n6. Integration with the PPA and Other Documents:\n - Section 25.12 confirms that this contract is integrated with the Public-Private Agreement (PPA) and other related documents, forming a single, interdependent agreement.\n\nThese provisions demonstrate that the contract is designed to function within a broader ecosystem of agreements and stakeholders, ensuring coordination and compliance across multiple entities.","Yes, the contract interfaces with other contracts and third-party entities. As stated in Section 2.1.2 of the DBC Executed Version, the DBC is part of an integrated set of agreements under the East End Crossing project, which includes the PPA (Public-Private Agreement) and other related documents.

"Who is assigned responsibility for managing interfaces, integrations, or interactions with other contracts or third parties?","Based on the provided sources, it appears that Design-Build Contractor is assigned responsibility for managing interfaces, integrations, or interactions with other contracts or third parties [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nAccording to Section 5.5.2.1 of the PPA, Design-Build Contractor is delegated the responsibilities and obligations of IFA under the IFA Utility Agreements [Source 1].\nDesign-Build Contractor is responsible for preparing, negotiating, and entering into Developer Utility Agreements with Utility Owners [Source 1].\nDesign-Build Contractor shall comply with and timely perform all obligations imposed on Design-Build Contractor or Developer by any Developer Utility Agreement [Source 1].\nDesign-Build Contractor is also responsible for coordinating with IFA, Developer, and third parties that own, manage, operate, or maintain Related Transportation Facilities [Source 3].\nIt can be inferred that Design-Build Contractor plays a key role in managing interfaces, integrations, or interactions with other contracts or third parties, including Utility Owners and Related Transportation Facilities [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. However, the exact scope and extent of this responsibility may require further information to provide a definitive answer.","Responsibility for managing interfaces, integrations, or interactions with other contracts or third parties is primarily assigned to the Design-Build Contractor, with support and coordination from Developer and IFA as needed. Key responsibilities include:\n\n1. Design-Build Contractor’s Primary Role:\n - The contractor is responsible for identifying and achieving compatibility, integration, and transition with Related Transportation Facilities (Section 8.1.4).\n - It must cooperate and coordinate with IFA, Developer, and third parties that own, manage, operate, or maintain Related Transportation Facilities (Section 8.1.3).\n - It must not interfere with IFA’s reserved rights or third-party developments that may affect the project (Section 8.2).\n\n2. IFA’s Support Role:\n - IFA may assist in obtaining cooperation from third parties and enforcing rights or warranties, but is not obligated to initiate legal action (Section 8.1.5).\n - IFA may participate in meetings and discussions with third parties to support integration efforts.\n\n3. Developer’s Coordination Role:\n - Developer is responsible for consulting with the Design-Build Contractor and providing opportunities to review and comment on scopes of work and budgets related to IFA’s assistance (Section 8.1.5).\n - Developer may request the contractor’s input for impact analysis when IFA considers pursuing Business Opportunities (Section 8.2.5).\n\n4. Indemnity and Liability:\n - The Design-Build Contractor is required to indemnify Developer and IFA against third-party claims arising from its actions or omissions (Section 17.5).\n - Developer also provides reciprocal indemnity for its own acts (Section 17.5A).\n\nIn summary, the Design-Build Contractor bears the primary responsibility for managing third-party interfaces, with Developer and IFA providing support, coordination, and oversight as needed.","The Design-Build Contractor is assigned primary responsibility for managing interfaces with other contracts and third parties. According to:\n\nSection 2.1.2: The Contractor must coordinate with the Developer, IFA, KYTC, and others to ensure integration with related agreementsDBC Executed Version.\n\nSection 5.5: The Contractor is responsible for managing Utility Adjustments, including coordination with Utility OwnersDBC Executed Version.\n\nExhibit 2-C (Interface Matrix): Lists specific third parties and activities for which the Contractor must manage interactions.\n\nThe Contractor must ensure timely cooperation, integration, and compliance across all interfacing entities."
"What liabilities does the Client have regarding contract interfaces, integrations, or interactions?","Based on the provided sources, the Client (IFA) has several liabilities regarding contract interfaces, integrations, or interactions [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nIFA is responsible for approving or rejecting Change Requests proposed by Developer [Source 2].\nIFA has the right to report directly to insurers and process their respective claims against applicable Insurance Policies [Source 2].\nIFA is an additional insured under the liability insurance policy, and the policy shall be written so that no act or omission of a named insured shall vitiate coverage of the additional insureds [Source 3].\nIFA may be liable for fines and penalties under statute or any reasonable costs incurred by Developer or any Developer-Related Entity in complying with statutory obligations or any order of a Governmental Authority [Source 1].\nIt can be inferred that IFA has significant liabilities and responsibilities regarding contract interfaces, integrations, or interactions, including approval of changes, insurance claims, and compliance with statutory obligations [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3]. However, the exact scope and extent of these liabilities may require further information to provide a definitive answer.","The Client (Developer) has limited liabilities regarding interfaces, integrations, or interactions with other contracts or third parties under the Design-Build Contract. Key points include:\n\n1. Primary Responsibility Lies with the Design-Build Contractor:\n - The Design-Build Contractor is responsible for managing interactions with third parties, including utilities, governmental entities, and other contractors (Sections 8.1.4, 8.1.5, 17.5.1.9).\n - The Contractor must indemnify the Developer for claims arising from its failure to perform obligations under third-party agreements or from disputes with third parties (Section 17.5.1.10).\n\n2. Developer’s Support Role:\n - The Developer may assist in coordinating with third parties but is not obligated to initiate legal action (Section 8.1.5).\n - The Developer may be required to provide analysis or participate in discussions regarding Business Opportunities or Reserved Airspace, but the risk and cost impacts are generally passed through to the Contractor (Section 8.2.5).\n\n3. Indemnification Protections:\n - The Developer is indemnified by the Contractor for third-party claims, including those related to taxes, liens, hazardous materials, and interference with other contractors (Section 17.5.1).\n - The Developer’s liability is limited to its own negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of material obligations (Section 17.5.2).\n\n4. Dispute Resolution and Defense Rights:\n - The Developer has the right to assume its own defense in third-party claims if the Contractor fails to provide an effective defense or lacks financial capacity (Section 17.6.6).\n - The Developer may settle claims with or without the Contractor’s consent, depending on the circumstances (Section 17.6.7).\n\nIn summary, while the Developer may engage in coordination and oversight, the Design-Build Contractor bears the primary liability and responsibility for managing third-party interfaces and ensuring compliance with related obligations.","The Client (IFA) has limited but defined liabilities regarding interfaces and interactions:\n\nIFA-Provided Approvals & Coordination: IFA is responsible for securing certain permits, approvals, and agreements listed in the contract (e.g., NEPA approvals), and must coordinate with Governmental Entities for those approvals (Section 6.3.1.1)DBC Executed Version.\n\nUtility Obligations: IFA is liable for delays or costs only if they fail to fulfill their obligations in coordinating with Utility Owners under Section 5.5.6, provided the Contractor meets its own obligationsDBC Executed Version.\n\nExhibit 2-C (Interface Matrix): Outlines responsibilities shared or assigned to IFA regarding third-party coordination, which may give rise to limited liability if IFA fails to perform its assigned interface duties."
Is the Contractor expected to coordinate with parties to contracts other than this contract?,"Based on the provided sources, it appears that the Contractor (Design-Build Contractor) is expected to coordinate with parties to contracts other than this contract [Source 1, Source 2].\n\nAccording to Section 8.1.3 of the Design-Build Contract, Design-Build Contractor shall cooperate and coordinate with IFA, Developer, and any third party that owns, manages, operates, or maintains a Related Transportation Facility [Source 2].\nAdditionally, Design-Build Contractor is required to coordinate with IFA, Developer, and third parties that own, manage, operate, or maintain Related Transportation Facilities to minimize disruption to the operation of the East End Crossing and the Related Transportation Facility [Source 2].\nIt is also stated that Design-Build Contractor shall have the right to make copies of plans, surveys, drawings, as-built drawings, specifications, reports, and other documents and information in the possession of IFA or its contractors and consultants pertaining to Related Transportation Facilities [Source 2].\nIt can be inferred that the Contractor is expected to coordinate with various parties, including IFA, Developer, and third-party owners or operators of Related Transportation Facilities, to ensure the successful completion of the project [Source 1, Source 2].","Yes, the Contractor is explicitly expected to coordinate with parties to contracts other than this contract. The contract outlines several obligations and expectations in this regard:\n\n1. Coordination with Related Transportation Facilities:\n - The Contractor must identify and ensure compatibility, integration, and transition with Related Transportation Facilities (Section 8.1.4).\n - The Contractor is required to cooperate and coordinate with IFA, the Developer, and any third party that owns, manages, operates, or maintains a Related Transportation Facility (Section 8.1.3).\n\n2. Support from IFA:\n - IFA may assist in obtaining cooperation from third parties, including participation in meetings and discussions, but is not obligated to initiate legal action (Section 8.1.5).\n - The Contractor must reimburse IFA for reasonable costs incurred in providing such assistance.\n\n3.

What payment retention or equivalent mechanisms are specified in this contract?,"Based on the provided sources, it appears that the contract specifies payment retention or equivalent mechanisms [Source 1, Source 3].\n\nThe contract states that the contracting agency shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics [Source 1].\nThe contract also mentions that payments made to contractors and suppliers to satisfy claims on the payment bond do not reduce the Surety’s legal obligations under the Bond [Source 3].\nAdditionally, the contract states that the Surety shall make available as work progresses, sufficient funds to pay the cost of completion less the unpaid balance of the contract price, but not exceeding the bonded sum [Source 3].\nIt can be inferred that the contract includes mechanisms for payment retention, such as withholding payments to ensure compliance with labor laws and payment bond claims [Source 1, Source 3]. However, the exact details and extent of these mechanisms may require further information to provide a definitive answer.","The contract includes a specific mechanism for payment retention, referred to as “retainage,” as well as other related provisions. Key points include:\n\n 1. Retainage (Section 7.15)\n- The Developer is entitled to withhold a portion of each payment to the Design-Build Contractor as retainage.\n- The amount and terms of retainage are governed by the contract and applicable law.\n- Retainage serves as a financial safeguard to ensure the Contractor completes the work satisfactorily.\n\n 2. Withholding for Noncompliance or Defaults\n- The Developer may withhold payments in cases of Developer Default (Section 19.4.2.2), including failure to pay undisputed amounts.\n- The Contractor may suspend work if payment is not made within 45 days, subject to specific conditions (e.g., maintaining site safety and insurance).\n\n 3. Interest on Late Payments (Section 10A.3)\n- If payments are delayed, interest may accrue, but not beyond the maximum legal rate.\n- Any excess interest must be refunded.\n\n 4. Claims and Dispute Resolution\n- The Contractor may claim compensation for losses due to delayed payments or other Developer Defaults (Section 19.4.2.1).\n- Remedies include suspension of work and recovery of losses, subject to conditions and limitations.\n\nIn summary, the contract provides for retainage as a standard payment retention mechanism and includes provisions for withholding, interest on late payments, and remedies for nonpayment.","The contract does not specify a traditional payment retention mechanism, but it includes equivalent security provisions:\n\nLiquid Security (Section 17.5C.3):\n\n7.5% of the Contract Sum from issuance to Substantial Completion,\n\nReduced to 3.75% until Final Acceptance,\n\nThen 1.5% through the Warranty Period.\n\nMay increase to 200% of Corrective Work value if the Warranty Period is extendedDBC Executed Version.\n\nThis Liquid Security functions similarly to retention, securing performance and warranty obligations in lieu of withholding payments."
What is the level or percentage of holdback required in this contract?,"Based on the provided sources, the level or percentage of holdback required in this contract is not explicitly stated [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that the contracting agency shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics [Source 1].\nAdditionally, the contract states that payments made to contractors and suppliers to satisfy claims on the payment bond do not reduce the Surety’s legal obligations under the Bond [Source 3].\nIt can be inferred that the contract includes mechanisms for payment retention, but the exact percentage or level of holdback is not specified [Source 1, Source 3].\nIt is recommended to review the contract documents further to determine the exact level or percentage of holdback required, as this information is not readily available in the provided sources [Source 1, Source 2, Source 3].","The contract specifies a tiered “Liquid Security” mechanism that functions similarly to a holdback or retainage. The required percentages of the Contract Sum are as follows (Section 17.2.2A):\n\n1. From the date of provision of the Liquid Security until the Substantial Completion Date:\n - 7.5% of the Contract Sum.\n\n2. From the day after the Substantial Completion Date until the Final Acceptance Date:\n - 3.75% of the Contract Sum.\n\n3. From the day after the Final Acceptance Date until the expiration of the Warranty Period:\n - 1.5% of the Contract Sum.\n\n - If the Warranty Period is extended due to Corrective Work, the amount may be reduced to 200% of the value of the outstanding Corrective Work.\n\nThis Liquid Security serves as a financial safeguard for the Developer and is structured to decrease as the project progresses and obligations are fulfilled.","The contract does not use a traditional payment holdback, but instead requires Liquid Security that functions equivalently. Per Section 17.5C.3 of the DBC Executed Version, the required levels are:\n\n7.5% of the Contract Sum from Commercial Close to Substantial Completion,\n\nReduced to 3.75% from Substantial Completion to Final Acceptance,\n\nFurther reduced to 1.5% through the end of the Warranty Period.\n\nThis security ensures performance and warranty compliance in place of a standard holdbackDBC Executed Version."
Does the contract require any payment retention beyond the statutory holdback?,"Based on the provided sources, it appears that the contract does require payment retention beyond the statutory holdback [Source 3].\n\nThe contract states that Developer shall be entitled to withhold from any payment to be made to Design-Build Contractor under this Agreement, such reasonable amounts as are necessary for so long as is necessary to protect itself against any Losses or claims arising from certain specified events [Source 3].\nThese events include any Defect that Design-Build Contractor fails to correct within thirty (30) days, any third-party claims for which Design-Build Contractor is responsible, and any damages to property for which Design-Build Contractor is responsible [Source 3].\nThe contract also allows Developer to withhold amounts for liens arising in connection with the D&C Work, other than as a direct result of payment default by Developer, and for any Quarterly Noncompliance Adjustment [Source 3].\nIt can be inferred that the contract includes mechanisms for payment retention beyond the statutory holdback, allowing Developer to withhold payments to protect itself against potential losses or claims [Source 3]. However, the exact details and extent of these mechanisms may require further information to provide a definitive answer.","Yes, the contract requires payment retention beyond the statutory holdback through a mechanism called “Liquid Security.” This is detailed in Section 17.2.2A of the contract and functions similarly to a holdback or retainage. The required percentages of the Contract Sum are:\n\n- 7.5% from the date of provision of the Liquid Security until the Substantial Completion Date.\n- 3.75% from the day after the Substantial Completion Date until the Final Acceptance Date.\n- 1.5% from the day after the Final Acceptance Date until the expiration of the Warranty Period (or 200% of the value of outstanding Corrective Work if the Warranty Period is extended).\n\nAdditionally, Section 17.2.2.2(a) confirms that retainage is also withheld under individual contracts with subcontractors and suppliers, and the Design-Build Contractor must certify that such retainage is being properly managed.\n\nTherefore, the contract imposes a structured, tiered retention mechanism that goes beyond statutory requirements to ensure performance and protect against claims.","Yes, the contract effectively requires payment retention beyond any statutory holdback through its Liquid Security provisions. As specified in Section 17.5C.3 of the DBC Executed Version, the Contractor must provide:\n\n7.5% of the Contract Sum through Substantial Completion,\n\nThen 3.75% until Final Acceptance,\n\nThen 1.5% through the Warranty Period.\n\nThese percentages are contractually required and separate from any statutory holdback, functioning as extended performance and warranty securityDBC Executed Version."
Does the contract allow payment retentions to be replaced by bonds or other financial instruments?,"Based on the provided sources, it appears that the contract does allow for payment retentions to be replaced by bonds or other financial instruments [Source 1, Source 3].\n\nAccording to the contract, the Surety shall make available as work progresses, sufficient funds to pay the cost of completion less the unpaid balance of the contract price, but not exceeding the bonded sum [Source 1].\nThe contract also mentions that payments made to contractors and suppliers to satisfy claims on the payment bond do not reduce the Surety’s legal obligations under the Bond [Source 1].\nAdditionally, the contract states that the Surety may, at its option, make any payments under the Payment Bond by check issued jointly to all of the obligees [Source 2].\nIt can be inferred that the contract includes mechanisms for payment retention, such as withholding payments to ensure compliance with labor laws and payment bond claims, and allows for the use of bonds or other financial instruments to secure payment [Source 1, Source 3].\nHowever, the exact details and extent of these mechanisms may require further information to provide a definitive answer.","Yes, the contract allows payment retentions to be replaced by financial instruments, specifically letters of credit. This is addressed in Section 17.3 of the contract:\n\n- The Developer may draw on a letter of credit provided by the Design-Build Contractor if the Contractor fails to deliver a new or replacement letter of credit at least 30 days before the current one expires (Section 17.3.1.3).\n- The Developer may retain the full face amount of the letter of credit as cash security if drawn (Section 17.3.1.3).\n- Draws on letters of credit are not conditioned on prior resort to the Contractor or other security (Section 17.3.1.4).\n- The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with obtaining and maintaining the letter of credit (Section 17.3.1.6).\n- If the Developer assigns its rights under the contract, the Contractor must cooperate to amend or replace the letter of credit to name the assignee as beneficiary (Section 17.3.1.7).\n\nThis mechanism effectively allows the Contractor to substitute a letter of credit for traditional retainage, subject to the Developer’s rights and conditions outlined in the contract.","Yes, the contract allows payment retentions—specifically, Liquid Security—to be provided in the form of bonds or other financial instruments. According to Section 17.5C.3 of the DBC Executed Version, the Contractor may satisfy its Liquid Security obligation using:\n\nCash,\n\nLetters of Credit, or\n\nSurety Bonds,\n\nprovided they meet the requirements set forth in the DBC and are acceptable to the Developer and IFADBC Executed Version."
